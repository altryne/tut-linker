# Toot Linker

Toot Linker is a tool that allows you to share your Mastodon posts on Twitter while still showing the preview on Twitter. Twitter has started blocking all Mastodon links, but Toot Linker provides a solution by creating a redirect website that Twitter's bots will not block as malicious.

## How to use Toot Linker

To use Toot Linker, you will need to provide your Mastodon server URL and your Mastodon username. Toot Linker will then create a redirect link that you can share on Twitter. When someone clicks on the link, they will be taken to the original Mastodon post, but the preview will still be displayed on Twitter.

You can either deploy Toot Linker to Cloudflare Workers or use the hosted version at https://toot-linker.altryne.workers.dev.

## Example

Here is an example of how you might use Toot Linker:

Write a new Mastodon post on your Mastodon server.
Copy the URL of the post.
Go to Toot Linker and enter your Mastodon server URL and your Mastodon username.
Paste the URL of the Mastodon post into the Toot Linker input field.
Click "Generate Link".
Copy the generated link and share it on Twitter.
